# ESP32-P4-86-Panel-ETH-2RO LVGL Firmware 
ESPHome Configuration for the ESP32-P4-86-Panel-ETH-2RO with an LVGL UI.

All credit for getting this working goes to https://github.com/alaltitov/Waveshare-ESP32-P4-86-Panel-ETH-2RO.
All credit and inspiration for the original UI and device configuration goes to https://github.com/BigBobbas/ESP32-S3-Box3-Custom-ESPHome/.

This is a port of my S3 box configuration https://github.com/chrisdunnname/esphome-s3-box-3-lvgl.

This firmware provides the ESP32-P4-86-Panel-ETH-2RO (and non ethernet version) with a voice assistant, timers, screen saver with analog/digital clock and sleep, 12/24 hour time, media controls, alarm integration, alarm clock, internal and external audio, notifications with sound, and multiple pages for lights, thermostats, switches, media, scenes, locks other devices from your Home Assistant.
A weather service from Home Assistant (e.g. open weather map) can provide temperature and condition for the screen saver.

A large number of entities are exposed to Home Assistant including a notification text entity that provides the ability to push notifications to the device which will display on screen for 10 seconds (with an optional notification sound) and an Image URL entity that provides the ability to push the URL for a PNG image to the device which will display on screen for 30 seconds (with no notification sound). This can be used with a [JPG to PNG Converter](https://github.com/youkorr/hacs-jpg-to-png-converter) in an automation to capture a snapshot from a camera and push it to the device.

A UI Mode feature provides the ability to switch the UI theme with 4 modes: Default, Dark, Grey, Light.
A VA Mode feature provides the ability to switch the voice assistant animated UI with 3 modes: Default, HAL, Home.
Each provides a different theme and voice assistant interface.
- Default provides a standard ESPHome and Home Assistant experience. 
- HAL provides an animated Space Odyssey inspired 2001 HAL voice assistant.
- Home provides an animated Google inspired voice assistant.

A no animation YAML configuration is provided that provides the UI Mode but the VA mode does not apply for much smaller firmware.

The wakeword is not tied to the VA Mode providing flexibility for your preferred experience.

The On Device Wake Word includes the standard ESPHome wakeword models (4) but also some experimental models including okay hal and hey luna.
Additional experimental wake words for okay computer and hey home assistant and included in the config but disabled by default. 

The UI and Voice Assistant experience is implemented out of the box.
Only basic configuration is required to integrate the standard features with your Home Assistant.

# Getting Started

**First Time?**

The easy way to get started is to create an entry in ESPHome for your new device and paste in the contents of the esp32-p4-86-panel.yaml file in this repository. You can edit the device names as required.
See the basics below to ensure you have added the 3 required secrets to your ESPHome before compiling. 
For your new configuration choose Install>Download and compile the code for your device. When this process completes, download the file in modern format for the ESPHome Web Installer.
Connect your new device to your computer and open this site: [https://web.esphome.io/?dashboard_install](https://web.esphome.io/?dashboard_install)
Follow the steps to Connect your device and load the file you downloaded earlier to flash the device. 
Once complete your device should reboot and start. 

Your Home Assistant will recognize the device so you can add it.

When you add the device there is one more option you will need. If you want to use the capabilities of the box to control devices in your Home Assistant you have to give it permission. 
In Devices>EspHome find the device and click the cog next to it.

![devices-esphome](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2b65e1a-f0a4-41d1-aed0-be1a18f3f057)

Then choose to allow the device to perform Home Assistant Actions.

![allowdeviceactions](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9cebb38a-4398-4040-bfd4-b1b20f2d2111)

You can keep the name from your initial installation but change the rest with the content from this file and then compile this and install the updated configuration wirelessly. See the basics below to ensure you have the three required secrets configured before you compile.
The configuration provided will work out of the box but you won't have any buttons to control lights or switches and it won't connect to an external speaker for audit. This is where the configuration options in the config come into play. The first 200 lines are all options that can be adjusted to tailor your box for you and push out new wireless updates to test your changes. 

**Configuration**

See [CONFIGURATION.md](https://github.com/chrisdunnname/esphome-p4-86-panel-eth-2ro-lvgl/blob/main/CONFIGURATION.md) for further details on the YAML configuration.

**Additional Information**

See [USAGE.md](https://github.com/chrisdunnname/esphome-p4-86-panel-eth-2ro-lvgl/blob/main/USAGE.md) for further details of the available Home Assistant entities and how they can be used.
